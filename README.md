A little project I did trying to learn C following the concpets given in [Tsoding's ml playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VZPZKggcql-MmjaBdZKeDMw).

Currently the model works by using the finite difference formula to optimize each parameter. A usage example can be found in main.c
